    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>4.1 Several areas of the Tapkey Platform use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on the computer, smartphone and/or browser. These are used by Tapkey to provide a more user-friendly, effective and secure service. Cookies also allow Tapkey to identify the browser used and to provide certain offers to the user. Cookies do not contain any information that can be individualized.</p>
    <p>4.2 The User has the possibility at any time to refuse the setting of cookies, by selecting the appropriate option in the browser settings. However, it should be noted that disabling cookies may reduce the scope of the Services or negatively affect the use of the Services on the Tapkey Platform.</p>
    <h2>5. Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>5.1 The Tapkey Platform uses Google Analytics, a network analysis service provided by Google Inc (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies” (see point 4, above). The information regarding the visit of a website or app, including the IP address, is collected by the cookie and usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If a website has IP anonymization enabled, Google first shortens IP addresses from member states of the European Union and EEA states. The full IP address is then, only as an exception, transmitted to the Google server in the USA and only shortened there. Google uses the information collected on behalf of the website provider to analyze the use of the Tapkey platform, to compile reports on website activity and to provide additional services to Tapkey regarding the Tapkey platform and the use of the internet. Under no circumstances will Google link the IP address transmitted by the browser as part of Google Analytics with other Google data.</p>
    <p>5.2 When accessing the Website, the User can prevent Google’s recording and processing of information regarding the use of the Tapkey Platform, including the IP address, by downloading and installing the following browser plugin: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en/</a>.</p>
    <p>5.3 For more information about the terms of use and privacy policy of Google Analytics, the User can visit the pages <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html</a> and <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/</a>.</p>
    <h2>6. Google Ads</h2>
    <p>Tapkey uses the Google Ads Conversion tool to advertise Tapkey’s product offerings on websites operated by third parties. Based on these tools, we can measure the success of individual advertising campaigns. This allows us to take your interests into account when displaying advertising offers and to optimize our online presence for your customer experience. Advertisements are served by Google via their ad server infrastructure. For this purpose, ad server cookies are used to measure the effectiveness of displayed ads (display and user interaction). When you click on an ad, Google Ads stores a cookie on your terminal device. These cookies are not intended to be used for personal identification and expire after a certain period of time (usually 30 days). A cookie can store several pieces of information, such as the last time the ad was displayed, the number of impressions and a unique cookie ID as well as any opt-out settings (made by the user). We do not receive any personal profile data from Google (we cannot identify you personally) but only statistical information that is intended to continuously improve our advertising campaigns.</p>
    <p>Google remarketing: we also use the remarketing option of Google services. This allows us to play out personalized advertising on other websites based on your interests with reference to our online offering. This option is limited to a maximum of 18 months. You can find more information here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en" target="_blank">Privacy Policy of Google</a>. In addition, it is possible to suppress the display of interest-based advertising by <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996" target="_blank">installing a browser plugin.</a></p>
    <h2>7. LinkedIn Insight</h2>
    <p>We use the conversion tool “LinkedIn Insight Tag” of the company LinkedIn Ireland on our website. By using it, a cookie is created in your web browser, which enables the collection of the following data, among others: IP address, device details and browser info, as well as page events (e.g. number of page views). The collected data is encrypted and anonymized within seven days. LinkedIn does not share any personal information with us, but only enables reports on website target groups and display performance in anonymous form. Based on this cookie, targeted advertising can be displayed outside of Tapkey websites without personal identification of the website visitor. More information about data protection on the LinkedIn platform can be found in the LinkedIn Privacy Terms.</p>
    <h2>8. Facebook Pixel</h2>
    <p>Tapkey uses the Facebook Pixel tool. A cookie is stored on your device by Facebook Pixel for this purpose. Data collected via Facebook Pixel is processed by Facebook and is not directly accessible to Tapkey. The use of Facebook Pixel allows us to play ads on the Facebook platform based on your browsing behavior and to measure and continuously optimize the success of ad placements for statistical purposes. You can individually configure the display of advertisements on the Facebook platform with the corresponding settings provided.</p>
    <h2>9. Zendesk</h2>

Further information on data analysis by CleverReach newsletters is available at: <a href="https://www.cleverreach.com/en/features/reporting-tracking/" target="_blank">https://www.cleverreach.com/en/features/reporting-tracking/</a>.</p>
    <p>10.2 In order to sign up for the Tapkey newsletter, a User must enter and confirm his/her email address (double opt-in). This data is forwarded to CleverReach and stored on its server.</p>
    <p>10.3 The user can revoke the consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in each newsletter message. The user data will be deleted from the CleverReach servers. However, the legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.
