<main>
	<p>We, the team of Tapkey, Brucknerstraße 2/6, 1040 Vienna, Austria (“Tapkey”), are pleased to see you being interested in our products and we are confident that our products match your interests perfectly.</p>
	<p>To use our products, we have to clarify certain things with you. For example, the rights and responsibilities we owe each other, how long various periods last and many more details. One of them is regarding the integration with Tapkey.</p>
	<p>Since it is not possible for us, for technical reasons and due to limited personnel resources, to negotiate the terms of use with each individual who wishes to use the Tapkey products, we have drafted the following general terms and conditions (“T&amp;C”) for parties which want to integrate with Tapkey products.</p>
